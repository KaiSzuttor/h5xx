                        is implemented in "redesign.khr"

    2014/10/21 : feho : some more ideas than in "redesign", need to be
                        implemented and merged into redesign.khr
  remotes/stuttgart/sandbox/klaus.reuter/redesign.khr
    2015/06/25 : khr : push of redesign.khr (went into sandbox, for whatever reason),
                       contains remotes/stuttgart/redesign.khr


CONCLUSION

* Around 2015/05, .git/config was edited and the push target for "redesign.khr"
  was changed to the sandbox location, for whatever weird reason.

* TODO:
      *  merge redesign.khr into redesign,
         look at feho's sandbox "redesign", understand, implement,
         push redesign to github:redesign
      * implement better test cases
